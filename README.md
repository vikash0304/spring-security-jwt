spring security and jwt token

Spring Security JWT is a security framework that uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate and authorize users. JWTs are self-contained tokens that contain information about the user, such as their identity and permissions.

Spring Security JWT provides a number of benefits, including:

# Stateless Authentication:
Once a user is authenticated, the server does not need to maintain any state about the user. This makes the server more scalable and secure.

# Secure Communication:
JWTs are signed using a secret key, which makes them difficult to forge.

# Flexibility:
 JWTs can be used to implement a variety of authentication and authorization schemes.

# To use Spring Security JWT, you need to configure Spring Security to use the JWTAuthenticationTokenFilter. This filter will intercept all requests and check for a valid JWT token in the Authorization header. If a valid token is present, the filter will authenticate the user and set the user in the Spring Security context.
